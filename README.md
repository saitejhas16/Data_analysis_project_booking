## 🔹 **Data Preprocessing (Python)**
Before analysis, the dataset underwent **extensive cleaning and transformation** in Python. The following steps were performed:  

✔ **Handling Missing Values**:  
- Replaced missing Customer Phone values with `"N/A"`.  
- Labeled missing Time Slots as `"Unknown"`.  

✔ **Duplicate Removal**:  
- Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure accuracy.  

✔ **Data Type Standardization**:  
- Converted **Booking Date** to datetime format for trend analysis.  
- Converted **Price & Duration** to numeric values for calculations.  

✔ **Outlier Detection & Handling**:  
- Applied the **Interquartile Range (IQR) method** to check for extreme values.  
- Verified that all values were within a reasonable range.

## 🔹 **Power BI Dashboard Insights**
After cleaning the data, an **interactive Power BI dashboard** was built to visualize key trends and insights.  

✔ **KPIs for Quick Business Overview**  
- **Total Revenue**  
- **Total Bookings**  
- **Unique Customers**  
- **Average Revenue Per Booking**  

✔ **Data Visualizations**  
- **Booking Trends Over Time** – Identifies seasonal demand fluctuations.  
- **Revenue Breakdown by Booking Type** – Highlights the most profitable services.  
- **Top 10 Spending Customers** – Helps identify high-value clients.  
- **Facility Performance Analysis** – Determines which locations generate the most revenue.  
- **Revenue Heatmap** – Displays monthly revenue distribution across booking types.  

✔ **Interactivity & Filters**  
- Users can filter data by **Booking Type, Date Range, Customer Name, and Booking Status** to explore insights dynamically.
